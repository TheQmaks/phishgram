# phishgram - Toolkit for authorized red-team simulations on Telegram

> ⚠️ **LEGAL DISCLAIMER**: This tool is intended ONLY for authorized security testing, red-team operations, and educational purposes. Using this tool without explicit permission from the target is ILLEGAL and unethical. The authors are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool.

A credential harvesting framework that creates a fake Telegram login interface to capture user credentials, then automatically submits them to the real Telegram Web to verify their validity. Designed for authorized penetration testing and security assessments.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 One-command setup with Cloudflare tunnel
- 🎭 Authentic Telegram UI with animations
- 🔄 Real-time credential validation via Puppeteer
- 🎯 Multi-step auth support (phone, SMS, 2FA)
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design

## 🏗️ How it Works

1. Serves fake Telegram login interface via tunnel URL
2. Captures credentials through WebSocket
3. Validates credentials against real web.telegram.org using Puppeteer
4. Redirects target to real Telegram upon success
